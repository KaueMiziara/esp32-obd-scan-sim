# OBD-II Simulator
---

This simulator is a simple tool designed for testing purposes.

It emulates the behavior of an On-Board Diagnostics II (OBD-II) sensor using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication.

## Overview
---
I am creating a mobile app that communicates with an OBD-II sensor.

This project is designed to assist in testing and debugging the app.

It emulates OBD-II sensor behavior, allowing you to simulate OBD data responses via BLE communication.

## Features
---
- Emulates OBD data responses based on received commands.
- Supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication for mobile device interaction.
- Generates random data to simulate OBD responses.
